0.4.3 (trunk):
* Add Travis CI scripts.
* Fix ARMv5 compilation.

0.4.2 (2013-10-05):
* Properly initialise the shared event counters. This bug prevented the
  backend from notifying the frontend, causing deadlock.

0.4.1 (2013-07-25):
* Fix a ring corruption issue due to multi-byte stores and loads

0.4.0 (2013-04-30):
* Fix a ring corruption issue which could lead to dropped network packets
  or stalled disks
* Change ring API to improve debug messages

0.3.1 (2013-03-15):
* Fix unsigned comparisons in console/xenstore ring handling

0.3.0 (2013-02-22):
* Add support for ARM: each architecture requires support for memory barrier primitives
* For the xenstore-style rings, apply the memory barriers in the same way as the original xen implementation

0.2.0 (2012-02-08):
* Add `Lwt_ring` write and push functions that separate updates and notification, to support fragment-based protocols.
* Improve diagnostics support.

0.1.0 (2012-12-20):
* Initial public release.
* Update to new cstruct 0.6.0 API
* [xen] support for suspend and resume
* [xen] subpackages for console, xenstore rings
* [xen] fix data-loss bug in console, xenstore rings where a write
  was silently truncated when the ring was full
* Everything is pure OCaml except assembly for memory barriers and
  some unit tests
