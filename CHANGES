1.1.2 (2015-04-12)
* Do not make the installed library depend on `camlp4` (via `lwt.syntax`).
* Use centralised Travis scripts and modernise OPAM file.

1.1.1 (2015-01-09)
* add profiling/tracing support
* add a `Front.wait_for_free` function to wait for n free slots
* add `opam` file

* [xen]: add a prepare/commit interface to control when xenstore/console data is consumed
* [xen]: add read and write to complement unsafe_read and unsafe_write

1.0.0 (2013-12-07):
* Standardize indentation by running through ocp-indent.
* Improve ocamldoc for `Ring` module.

0.4.3 (2013-10-05):
* Add Travis CI scripts.
* Fix ARMv5 compilation.

0.4.2 (2013-10-05):
* Properly initialise the shared event counters. This bug prevented the
  backend from notifying the frontend, causing deadlock.

0.4.1 (2013-07-25):

* Fix unsigned comparisons in console/xenstore ring handling

0.3.0 (2013-02-22):
* Add support for ARM: each architecture requires support for memory barrier primitives
* For the xenstore-style rings, apply the memory barriers in the same way as the original xen implementation

0.2.0 (2012-02-08):
* Add `Lwt_ring` write and push functions that separate updates and notification, to support fragment-based protocols.
* Improve diagnostics support.

0.1.0 (2012-12-20):
* Initial public release.
* Update to new cstruct 0.6.0 API
* [xen] support for suspend and resume
* [xen] subpackages for console, xenstore rings

  some unit tests
